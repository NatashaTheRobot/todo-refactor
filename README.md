# Ruby Todo Refactoring
Author: Jesse Farmer &lt;[jesse@devbootcamp.com](mailto:jesse@devbootcamp.com)&gt;

Commented files from the refactoring presentation I gave on June 22, 2012 at Dev Bootcamp.

Each file is well-commented and guides you step-by-step through the refactoring process.  Well, hopefully.

Commented files are in <code>/comments</code>.  Uncommented files are in <code>/no_comments</code>.  It will be easier to see the differences between the files without the comments.

Send me an email if you have any questions!
