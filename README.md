# Ruby Todo Refactoring
Author: Jesse Farmer &lt;[jesse@devbootcamp.com](mailto:jesse@devbootcamp.com)&gt;

Commented files from the refactoring presentation I gave on June 22, 2012 at Dev Bootcamp.

Each file is well-commented and guides you step-by-step through the refactoring process.  Well, hopefully.

Send me an email if you have any questions!
